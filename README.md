# RoboLab

University project at TU Dresden. The idea of the project is to make a robot run on the planets with nodes that the robot should scan. The robot communicates with the server. The primary goal of the robot is to navigate to the target received from the server or explore entire planet.
I was responsible for implementing the decision-making logic for the robot. I implemented Dijkstra's algorithm, DFS algorithm and created my own version of intelligent exploration algorithm tailored to the project requirements.
My 2 other teammates worked on movement of the robot and communication with the server respectively. Please note that while I am showcasing my contributions to the project, I have not included my teammates' code in this repository to respect their privacy and intellectual property rights.
